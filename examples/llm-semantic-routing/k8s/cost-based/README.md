# Cost-Based Semantic Routing with vLLM Semantic Router

This example configures agentgateway and [vLLM Semantic Router (vSR)](https://vllm-semantic-router.com/)
to route OpenAI-compatible chat traffic to a lower-cost or higher-capability
model. vLLM Semantic Router classifies the request, selects a model, and
agentgateway forwards the request to OpenAI.

The included policy is tuned for coding prompts: routine implementation,
refactoring, unit tests, documentation, and simple debugging go to
`gpt-5.4-nano`. It escalates advanced distributed-systems design, formal
verification, difficult debugging, and research synthesis to `gpt-5.5`.
Its advanced keyword signal uses literal high-specificity phrases, while the
remaining semantic, complexity, context, and structure signals handle less
obvious requests.
Customize the signals, candidates, weights, and thresholds for your traffic by
following the [vLLM Semantic Router configuration guide](https://vllm-semantic-router.com/docs/installation/configuration/).

## Before You Begin

This example assumes a working agentgateway LLM path with cost and
observability data available:

- [Install agentgateway with Helm](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/main/documentation/install/helm/).
- [Set up an agentgateway proxy](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/main/documentation/setup/gateway/).
- [Configure OpenAI as an LLM provider](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/main/integrations/llm/providers/openai/).
- [Price LLM requests with a model cost catalog](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/main/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/).
- [Install an OpenTelemetry stack](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/main/documentation/observability/otel-stack/).

The `AgentgatewayBackend` in `agentgateway-routing.yaml` expects an
`openai-secret` in `agentgateway-system`, matching the provider setup guide.

## Configure Routing

Replace any existing `HTTPRoute` attached to this Gateway that matches
`/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/responses` before applying this example.

Install vLLM Semantic Router:

```bash
export VSR_CHART_VERSION=0.0.0-latest
export VSR_IMAGE_TAG=latest

helm upgrade -i semantic-router oci://ghcr.io/vllm-project/charts/semantic-router \
  --version "${VSR_CHART_VERSION}" \
  --namespace agentgateway-system \
  -f examples/llm-semantic-routing/k8s/cost-based/semantic-router-values.yaml \
  --set-string "image.tag=${VSR_IMAGE_TAG}" \
  --set "image.pullPolicy=Always"

kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployment/semantic-router \
  -n agentgateway-system \
  --timeout=600s
```

Apply the routed backend, route, and streamed ExtProc policy:

```bash
kubectl apply \
  -f examples/llm-semantic-routing/k8s/cost-based/agentgateway-routing.yaml

kubectl wait --for=condition=Accepted agentgatewaybackend/openai-router-selected \
  -n agentgateway-system \
  --timeout=300s
kubectl describe httproute openai-semantic-routing -n agentgateway-system
kubectl describe agentgatewaypolicy semantic-router-extproc -n agentgateway-system
```

This example defaults to the latest vSR chart and image, which include the
[Responses API streaming fix](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/issues/2446)
and the [FullDuplexStreamed request-body fix](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/issues/2486).
For a repeatable historical deployment, override both values with released
chart and image versions that contain both fixes.

## Run a Request

Set your gateway address:

```bash
export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS="http://$(kubectl get gateway agentgateway-proxy \
  -n agentgateway-system \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')"
```

Routine coding prompts should use the lower-cost model:

```bash
curl -sS -i "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-VSR-Debug: true" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Implement a small Go helper and one table-driven test."}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

Advanced distributed-systems prompts should use the higher-capability model:

```bash
curl -sS -i "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-VSR-Debug: true" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Design a distributed rate limiter that remains correct during Redis failover and regional network partitions. Compare token bucket, sliding window, local fallback, and global reconciliation."}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

The response headers should include `x-vsr-selected-model: gpt-5.4-nano` for
the routine request and `x-vsr-selected-model: gpt-5.5` for the advanced
request. The debug header is for verification only and should not be required
by application traffic.

### Force a Model Tier

The default configuration allows a client to request either configured model
directly. This bypasses vSR's automatic model selection, while retaining the
same agentgateway forwarding, cost tracking, and observability path:

```bash
curl -sS -i "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Use the advanced model for this request."}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

The response body `model` field identifies the serving model. vSR response
headers record the explicit selection when available.

### Force Automatic Routing

To require automatic routing regardless of a client-provided model, apply the
optional override policy:

```bash
kubectl apply \
  -f examples/llm-semantic-routing/k8s/cost-based/force-auto.yaml
```

The policy uses an [agentgateway request-body
transformation](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/latest/documentation/traffic-management/transformations/validate/)
to rewrite the request's `model` field to `auto` before vSR selects a model.
Remove it to restore direct model selection:

```bash
kubectl delete \
  -f examples/llm-semantic-routing/k8s/cost-based/force-auto.yaml
```

Keep this optional policy disabled when running an evaluation that includes a
forced-model baseline, such as the cost-based semantic-routing demo's
`always_expensive` lane.

Agentgateway’s model catalog, metrics, logs, and traces remain the cost and
observability source of record. Use isolated evaluation traffic with forced
lower-cost and always-expensive baselines before adopting the policy broadly.

## Optional: Use Codex Through the Gateway

The gateway works with any OpenAI API-compatible client or agent. This optional
section configures Codex to use the gateway's `auto` model name. Codex uses the
OpenAI Responses API and vSR translates streamed Responses events before the
gateway forwards the request to the selected model.

For Codex CLI and ChatGPT desktop app setup, see [Use Codex with
agentgateway](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/latest/integrations/llm/clients/codex/).

### Verify Codex Routing

After sending a task through Codex, inspect the vSR decision:

```bash
kubectl logs -n agentgateway-system deploy/semantic-router --since=5m \
  | grep -E '"event":"routing_decision"|"event":"router_replay_complete"' \
  | tail -n 4
```

The vSR output identifies `original_model: auto`, the `selected_model`, and a
successful `response_status`.

The gateway authenticates to OpenAI with its configured provider credential and
records the selected model and cost as it does for other OpenAI-compatible
clients. Agentgateway can [rewrite client-facing model names with model
aliases](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/latest/documentation/llm/alias/). An
organization can also use a [request-body
transformation](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/latest/documentation/traffic-management/transformations/validate/)
to rewrite every request to `auto`. Treat `auto` as the supported client path
when testing this policy.

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete \
  -f examples/llm-semantic-routing/k8s/cost-based/agentgateway-routing.yaml
helm uninstall semantic-router -n agentgateway-system
```
