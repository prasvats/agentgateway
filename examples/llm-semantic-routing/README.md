# Semantic Routing Examples

These examples demonstrate different ways to integrate [vLLM Semantic Router (vSR)](https://vllm-sr.ai/)
with agentgateway.

All examples use the same core architecture:

```text
Client
   |
agentgateway
   |
vSR ExtProc
   |
LLM provider(s)
```

Each example focuses on a different production use case.

| agentgateway mode | Example | Demonstrates | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kubernetes | [Cost-based routing](k8s/cost-based/) | Route requests to lower-cost or higher-capability models based on semantic classification. | Cost optimization while maintaining response quality. |
| Kubernetes | [Tier-aware routing with CRDs](k8s/tier-aware/) | Select a tier-specific vSR runtime configured by `IntelligentPool` and `IntelligentRoute`. | Kubernetes-native pool/route management and separate runtimes per tier. |
| Kubernetes | [Tier-aware routing with one runtime](k8s/tier-aware-single-runtime/) | Combine tier and semantic signals in a single vSR runtime using the [v0.3 Unified Config Contract](https://vllm-sr.ai/docs/proposals/unified-config-contract-v0-3). | This example **does not** use the vSR `IntelligentPool` and `IntelligentRoute` CRDs. |
| Kubernetes | [Semantic caching](k8s/semantic-cache/) | Cache semantically equivalent requests in Redis Open Source and optionally share entries across vSR replicas. | Product support, documentation assistants, FAQ chatbots, and other workloads with many repeated questions. |
| Standalone | [Tier-aware routing](standalone/tier-aware-single-runtime/) | Use one YAML-configured vSR runtime with standalone agentgateway in Docker Compose. | Local development and deployments without Kubernetes. |

## Choosing an example

### Cost-based routing

Use this example when you want vSR to decide **which model** should answer a
request.

Typical goals include:

- reducing LLM cost
- balancing quality and latency
- automatically selecting inexpensive models for routine requests

See: `k8s/cost-based`

### Tier-aware routing

Use this example when different users are allowed to access different model
capabilities.

Typical goals include:

- Basic / Pro subscriptions
- internal vs external users
- premium AI features
- provider-specific model pools

Choose a deployment pattern:

- [Kubernetes with CRDs](k8s/tier-aware/): one vSR runtime per tier, with Kubernetes `IntelligentPool`
  and `IntelligentRoute` custom resources.
- [Kubernetes with one runtime](k8s/tier-aware-single-runtime/): one shared vSR runtime,
  with tier-aware decisions in a canonical YAML ConfigMap.
- [Standalone with Docker Compose](standalone/tier-aware-single-runtime/): one shared
  vSR runtime configured with canonical YAML.

All three examples demonstrate Basic, Standard, and Pro user entitlements and use
agentgateway for provider-based routing.

### Semantic caching

Use this example when many users ask **the same question in different ways**.

Instead of generating a new response for every request, vSR recognizes
semantically equivalent prompts and returns a previously generated response from
a Redis Open Source cache.

The example demonstrates:

- local kind deployment
- Redis Open Source 8 with vector search
- Redis-backed semantic cache
- semantic cache hits for paraphrased requests
- optional cache sharing across vSR replicas
- cache persistence across Redis pod restarts

vSR supports multiple cache backends, including a default in-memory store.
Redis is used here as a production-oriented backend because it allows vSR
replicas to share cache entries and persist them across process restarts. Redis
also backs other agentgateway-related services, such as [global rate
limiting](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/main/documentation/security/rate-limit-global/).
The example enables Redis persistence on a local persistent volume.
